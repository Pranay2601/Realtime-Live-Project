# DAML-Live-Project
The project is for a client from the tech entertainment industry that stands as one of the premier full-service entertainment agencies in the industry.

Business Operations:
The company operates through a network of Agents dedicated to assisting Presenters (customers) in securing Talent (Artists) for their events. This involves the meticulous management of the entire booking process, encompassing tasks such as working with Presenters to identify suitable talent, coordinating additional event requirements, overseeing contract negotiations, and facilitating payments between Presenters and Talent.
Agents at the company operate on a commission-based structure, earning compensation for each completed event. Additionally, they play a pivotal role in expanding the agency's clientele and talent pool, actively seeking new opportunities, and fostering business growth. 
With a strategic presence in multiple states across the United States, the company strategically focuses on local markets to better serve its diverse range of clients. 
The company has an internal CRM tool that is used for managing the entire process from initial connection to final payments.
Objectives of Data Analysis & Machine Learning:
The Sales Director at the company is tasked with developing key sales statistics and analytical insights to empower the company Board to make informed business decisions. These analyses encompass evaluating Agent performance, assessing company revenue, expenses, and profitability, as well as forecasting future business trends and opportunities. Such insights serve as essential tools in steering the agency toward sustained growth and success in the dynamic entertainment landscape.
